Summer Research 2025

This repo will contain the code I worked on during the summer using Julia and Python to solve the 1D dimensional case of the Coupled Mode Temporal Equations for the nonlinear Langevin Stochastic equation. This repo is currently in the working stages and will hopefully be updated more frequently with changes.

jlCMT.ipynb file solves the CMT equations and attempts to add a slider for mainpulating the values of pump max amplitude but there are errors due to conflicting packages

LLEjl.ipynb files solves for the nonlinear stochastic differential Langevin equation
